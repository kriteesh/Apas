#Water watch#
#This program is essentially for monitoring water bodies using google maps. Monitoring can serve us many purposes. #
1) How big and small water bodies are shrinking or expanding with seasons. 
2) How courses of different water bodies change and their parameters like sinuosity etc.
3) How urban enchroachment brings toll on local water bodies and aggravate water scarcity.
